## Project Description
The process of pairing up the mentors and mentees was troublesome and required the use of google forms, emails, with a lot of human intervention. 
We aim to create a web application that streamlines this process. MCIT students can sign up to be mentors or mentees on our web application and then answer a series of close-ended questions. Then, based on their responses, our app will run a matching algorithm (Galeâ€“Shapley algorithm for stable marriage problem) that determines a mentor-mentee match based on users' responses. Then, our app will send emails through SendGrid API to connect the mentor and the mentee.  

## Anticipated Tech Stack
* Frontend: React, CSS
* Backend: Node.js, Express, SendGrid API
* Database: MySQL, AWS RDS
