## Project Description
The process of pairing up the mentors and mentees was troublesome and required the use of google forms, emails, with a lot of human intervention. 
We aim to create a web application that streamlines this process. MCIT students can sign up to be mentors or mentees on our web application and then answer a series of close-ended questions. Then, based on their responses, we will run a matching algorithm that determines a mentor-mentee match based on users' responses, and then the users will be connected.
